# SYRIATEL COMPANY CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS PROJECT

USING BINARY CLASSIFICATION TO BUILD A MODEL THAT ACCURATELY PREDICTS CUSTOMER CHURN TO HELP SYRIATEL COMPANY IDENTIFY THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHURN AND TAKE PROACTIVE ACTIONS TOWARDS RETAINING THEIR CUSTOMERS

**OVERVIEW**

This is a binary classification project that conducts a chrn analysis for SyriaTel which is a telecommunication company in Syria.

* The data set also contains the feature 'churn,' which indicates whether a customer has churned or not which will be used as the target variable making the dataset suitable for analyzing customer churn as it contains all the necessary information to develop a predictive model.
* The data he dataset is large enough, with over 3,000 records, to support the development of a reliable and accurate predictive model.
